# Designengineer

A fictional job board for developers to find hybrid design and development roles.

## Why I Built this App
Before I became a software engineer, I spent a decade as a designer. I would love to be in a role that could use both my design and development skill sets, so I created a job board that I wish existed. 

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Webpack
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript
- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- AWS EC2
